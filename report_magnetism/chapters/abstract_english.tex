We use the three-dimensional spin lattice Monte Carlo code \emph{Sky-MoCa} to
investigate the skyrmion phase in chiral magnets non-perturbatively. We derive
the appropriate lattice Hamiltonian and discuss the relevant interactions as
well as their consequences. The thermodynamic phases and transitions between
them can be analyzed by means of Bragg intensity patterns and thermodynamic
properties such as the specific heat and the susceptibility. We specifically
demonstrate that the model does indeed exhibit the helical, conical and skyrmion
phase for appropriate choices of the temperature and the external field.
Subsequently we study the temperature driven transition from the unordered
random phase to the helical phase. Moreover, we cool the system into the
skyrmion phase and simulate both transitions driven by a change of the magnetic
field. First, we decrease the field until the skyrmion tubes start to touch and
gradually merge eventually resulting in the helical phase. Secondly, we increase
the magnetic field until the skyrmion tubes simply vanish and the system
transitions into the fully aligned phase. All observed phenomena qualitatively
match experimental data.
