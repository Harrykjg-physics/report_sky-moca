We give a general introduction to Monte Carlo methods with a special focus on
simulated annealing and the Metropolis algorithm. This report is conceived as an
ab-initio guide to implement and properly analyse simulated annealing by the
example of a three-dimensional lattice spin model. This system can be used to
simulate different phases of chiral magnets such as MnSi at finite temperature
in an external magnetic field. A thorough theoretical understanding of the
requirements, applicability and errors is developed and illustrated by reference
to the specific example. All code is publicly available for reproducability.
Common pitfalls are identified and we provide clear and practical guidelines on
how to avoid them.
