We employ a 3D lattice spin model to simulate different phases of chiral magnets
such as MnSi at finite temperature in an external magnetic field.  Focussing on
Monte Carlo methods, we describe our implementation in the Julia language in
great detail including best practices for Monte Carlo codes in general. In the
non-perturbative treatment we not only find a helical and conical phase, but we
show that it is also relatively easy to discover stable skyrmion tubes.
