We give a general introduction to Monte Carlo methods with a special focus on
simulated annealing and the Metropolis algorithm. This report is conceived as an
ab-initio guide to implement and properly analyse simulated annealing by the
example of a three-dimensional lattice spin model to simulate different phases
of chiral magnets such as MnSi at finite temperature in an external magnetic
field. A torough theoretic understanding of the requirements, applicability and
errors is developed and illustrated by reference to the specific implementation
we provide for the spin lattice model in the Julia language. Common pitfalls are
identified and we provide clear and practical guidelineson how to avoid them.
